# Algorithms-FordFulkerson-s-Algorithm-
Using Ford-Fulkerson's algorithm to find the Maximal flow in a network and solve the Bipartie matching problem.
### Uses the same Ford - Fulkerson's algorithm to solve maximal flow and the bipartite matching problem. The header file ford.h has the implementation of the Algorithm, and the .cpp files are for the specific probglems, the algo is explained in the comments and doucmentation also available.
